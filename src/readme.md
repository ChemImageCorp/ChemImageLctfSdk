# ChemImage LCTF SDK Example Projects

This directory includes a couple of example projects showing how an LCTF can be integrated into a C# application.

[Hyperspectral Image Capture](#hyperspectral-image-capture)

[LCTF Commander](#lctf-commander) 
## Hyperspectral Image Capture
[Source Code](https://github.com/ChemImageFT/ChemImageLctfSdk/tree/master/src/HyperspectralImageCapture)

This project is a console application showing how the LCTF can be tuned sequentially to all supported wavelengths 
and where code could be added to capture an image from a camera looking through the LCTF.

## LCTF Commander
[Source Code](https://github.com/ChemImageFT/ChemImageLctfSdk/tree/master/src/LCTFCommander)

This project is a WPF GUI application that is installed as part of the SDK. It shows how the LCTF can be
controlled through a user interface.
